[X]	: key.end(callback) -> make it actually work
[X]	: default data key -> find one that fits better
[X]	: {{}} -> render on init as well as async start
[X]	: {{}} -> can watch prop and render instead of render on asyncstart only
[ ]	: name="prop.{{}}" make it support supported (to support checkboxes)
[ ]	: move on-next-event-cycle into subscribable
[ ]	: proxyProtoObj.watch -> external watch prop api would be nice
[ ]	: nested foreach on the same level would be nice
[ ]	: sharing model objects would be nice
